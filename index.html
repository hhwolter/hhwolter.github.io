                <h1>The Guiding Forest</h1>
                <p class="major">A project by Horst Wolter in collaboration with Paulina Rosero.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Banana boxes?</strong> Yes, a stack of banana boxes, containing small landscapes, fragments
                    of a vast
                    primeval forest. But why would you place a forest in a banana box?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project began when I started a conversation with Paulina Rosero as part of the Art meets
                    Science program at Wageningen University. Paulina, who comes from Ecuador, is a researcher at WUR.
                    Her research focuses on the choices farmers in the Amazon rainforest make and how these choices are
                    influenced by people and organizations around them. These relationships play a significant role in
                    shaping the landscape.

                <p>
                    It’s through the concept of “landscape” that we found common ground. As an illustrator, I often draw
                    landscapes. These generally center around nature, but human influence on these landscapes is rarely
                    absent. (For examples of my illustrations, check,

                <h2>Landscape of Relationships</h2>
                <p>
                    During our discussions, Paulina and I developed the idea of a "landscape of relationships." For this
                    project, I left behind my usual 2D illustrations and explored spatial representation in 3D –
                    specifically in banana boxes. And not just any banana boxes, but those sourced from Ecuador. This
                    creates a direct connection between Paulina's research and this artwork.

                    In making these choices, guidance is ever-present. This applies not only to farmers in the

                    culture and/or faith, the government can provide incentives through subsidies or penalties,
                    traders influence choices, conservation organizations ask for support...

                    This influence is based on respect or reputation. The advice of a friend is more likely to be
                    followed than that of someone who often speaks harshly. You’re more inclined to respond to a family
                    member's call for help than to that of a stranger. The path of a successful person is more
                    attractive than that of a failure. Status-based influence is more pulling or inviting in nature.

                <p>
                    Confusion isn’t inherently bad. It implies that you’re reflecting. However, too much confusion can
                    lead to paralysis and discouragement, especially when compounded by dominant power factors.
                    Ultimately, this can lead to the destruction of choice itself. This destruction parallels the
                    experiences Paulina describes: <strong>power grabs lead to the destruction of the rainforest and
                        local
                        communities.</strong>

                    No, this isn’t a cheerful ending. But perhaps it’s not an ending at all. It’s better to see it as

                <h2>About the research</h2>
                <p>
                    For her research, Paulina uses a unique method: she plays a game – or, more accurately, she observes
                    people playing a game. The participants’ comments during the game form her raw data. Paulina and her
                    husband José developed the game themselves. At first glance, the game resembles Settlers of Catan.
                    The game board consists of hexagons that together form a piece of Amazon rainforest with a river.
                    Players choose whether to clear an area for farmland, then decide on livestock or specific crops.
                    Meanwhile, they must meet their subsistence needs and deal with events like droughts and floods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The participants weren’t random individuals but rather farmers from the Ecuadorian Amazon. Through
                    the game’s scenarios, participants reveal information that would be much harder to obtain through
                    surveys or interviews.
